## Hi there, I'm Anna! :sun_with_face:
Pronouns: she/her

I’m an MLIS student at Drexel University, and in my current coursework, I'm learning about:

+ [data/digital curation](https://github.com/topics/data-curation)
+ metadata & resource description
+ information & social justice

I'm passionate about public libraries, and right now, I'm most curious about cataloging and working with metadata. Outside of my courses, I would love to learn basic Python!!

Outside of school, I love to play board games, watch movies, explore the [Internet Archive](https://github.com/topics/internet-archive), and take long walks around Philly :sunflower:
