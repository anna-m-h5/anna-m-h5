## Hi there, I'm Anna! :sun_with_face:
Pronouns: she/her

Iâ€™m an MLIS student at Drexel University, and in my current coursework, I'm learning about:
+ digital curation/stewardship,
+ metadata & resource description
+ information & social justice. 

Outside of my courses, I would love to learn basic Python!!

And I like to play board games, watch movies, and take long walks around Philly:sunflower:
